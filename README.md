Descriptions:

One of the toughest challenges in investment management is to identify which aspects of a public company’s fundamentals affect its stock price. Even for a seasoned stock analyst, distilling information from large swaths of operating performance data and news remains difficult. Furthermore, financial data embody the concepts of “big messy data” because of its notoriously noisy nature and high-dimensionality. We believe that by using computer science, statistics, and big data analytics, we could gain profound insights into the complex financial data environment, and identify correlations between operating and stock performances. In this project, we would try to answer to questions: (1) how fundamentals of a publicly traded company affect its stock price; (2) Do fundamentals of public traded companies reflect health of the overall economy?
